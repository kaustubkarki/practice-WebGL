# This is a new repository from me to learn and complete my journey in the new THREE.js journey
# The source for my learning of this is from the famous BRUNOSIMON. I chose this project because I was very much impressed by his portfolio and I too want a portfolio like that.
# The tutorial by Bruno Simon is s(o)^99 beignier friendly that sometimes I just feel like punching my screen after he repeatedly explains same thing in each and every videos but I understand lol.
